NLP Tools and API Project

This repository features implementations of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques designed to make textual analysis simple and efficient. The project integrates core NLP methods like TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and VADER Sentiment Analysis with FastAPI to provide accessible, high-performance APIs.

Overview

Natural Language Processing is a cornerstone for various applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and sentiment analysis. This project focuses on building intuitive tools for text processing and analysis using Python, combined with a robust API structure via FastAPI.

Core Features
	•	TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Measure the importance of a term in a document concerning a collection of documents. Essential for information retrieval and text mining tasks.
	•	Cosine Similarity
A mathematical approach to calculate the similarity between text documents, providing insights into their contextual alignment.
	•	VADER Sentiment Analysis
An efficient rule-based sentiment analysis model optimized for social media text, evaluating positivity, negativity, and neutrality in expressions.
	•	API Endpoints with FastAPI
Fast and secure RESTful APIs offering NLP functionalities, equipped with automatic Swagger documentation for seamless interaction.
